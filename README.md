# Automated Data Pipeline for Sales Data in Google Cloud

Welcome to the project where we build an automated data pipeline for sales data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through the setup of a robust data pipeline that facilitates the seamless upload, storage, processing, and visualization of sales data.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of several GCP services to create an efficient and automated data pipeline for sales data. We will cover the following key components:

- **Web Portal**: Developed using Python Flask for uploading sales data files (CSV, Excel).
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Store the uploaded files in a GCS bucket.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Trigger a Cloud Function to process and load the data into BigQuery.
- **Looker Studio**: Create insightful dashboards and reports for data visualization.
